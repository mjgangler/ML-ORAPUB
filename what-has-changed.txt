Anomaly Detection System 1

What Changed?

1-Apr-2021 Changes

- There are new command line checks for for either 'db' or 'email'. The 'check' has been
  replaced by 'db'.

- DB configuration file credential changes are detected, then used without stoping the
  AD system from running. This allow you to dynamically change the database and user
  without stoping and restarting.

- If the AD system is unable to connect to or query from the DB, then system automatically
  refreshes DB credential file, sleeps, then continues main loop. The thinking is, you
  may want to intervine or are intervening, and we don't want to stop the sytem.

- There is a new parameter, data_max_samples_modeled. This is the maximum number of
  collected samples that will be used when creating the model. It's important to
  understand that the raw data is never removed or archived. So, the restart file will
  continue to grow and is unaffected by this parameter.
  
  If you want to reduce the size of the restart file, you will need to stop the system,
  make any change you want in the restart file, then restart collection.

  As with all parameters, this parameter can be changed (have fun!) and the effect will
  be immediate.
  
- There are now two models available, Kmeans and Isolation Forest. They are very
  different, though the plotted points appear in the same location. Why is that?

- You can change the size of the charts and the point size using these parameters,
    alert_chart_point_size_normal = 1
    alert_chart_point_size_anom   = 500
    alert_chart_width_inch        = 10.0
    alert_chart_height_inch       = 8.0

- The charts now show all anomalous points in magenta with the current sample in either
  green or red. This allows you to see where and what the model considers anomalous,
  which is great for adjusting and your learning.

- The 3D chart orientation can be using using the parameters,
    alert_chart_3D_elevate_angle    = -140.0
    alert_chart_3D_horizontal_angle = 45.0

- You can set the dimensional reduction model (PCA, ICA) with the parameter,
  dim_reduce_model. This is how the plotted point location can be changed. Changing
  this parameter does not affect anomaly detection because the reduced data is not
  fed into the ML algorithm.
  
- All configuration file changes take affect just before the next sample. So, you
  can experiment and quickly see the results.
  

24-Mar-2021 Changes
- Alert emails is now available.
- New configuration parameters to support the email alerting, AnomDetect.cfg
- New parameter file for your email settings, AnomDetect_Email.py
- Updated note and raw Python files, AnomDetect-1.ipynb and AnomDetect-1.py
- No client/workstation email related changes are necessary!
- All setup and deployment changes have been added to the
  AnomDetect-Setup-1e.txt file.

---------------------------------------------------
What To Backup
---------------------------------------------------

AnomDetect_DB.py - Back yours up if you are not accessing the OraPub Oracle database.

AnomDetect_Email.py - Back yours up because you will be using different emails than me.

AnomDetect.cfg - Back yours up because there are new parameters.


---------------------------------------------------
Testing
---------------------------------------------------

Ensure the AnomDetect _DB.py and AnomDetect_Email.py files are set appropriately.

Use the new AnomDetect.cfg file, not your current config file... there are too many
new things to adjust.

Work through the AnomDetect-Setup .txt file.

Enjoy!

Craig.
